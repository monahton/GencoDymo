# GencoDymo

## Data Extraction and Manipulation from the GENCODE Database

## Introduction

Gene annotations for the human genome has been made available by several databases integrating data from systematic explorations, curating and providing associated functional information of genes that have been built up in the recent years. The GENCODE project [1], part of the ENCODE project [2], offers accurate annotations of the human and mouse genomes from the literature, primary data repositories, computational predictions, manual annotation, and experimental validation of genes and transcripts including the noncoding transcripts which are continously discovered and annotated. GENCODE is by large one of the most comprehensive and standardized database for gene annotations that is widely used by the community. 
The gene sets are comprehensive and include protein-coding and non-coding loci including alternatively spliced isoforms and pseudogenes. GENCODE gene annotations are constantly updated and regularly released as the Ensembl/GENCODE gene sets which are accessible via their official website https://www.gencodegenes.org. GencoDymo is an R package that interrogates different releases of GENCODE annotations from the human and the mouse genomes. GencoDymo extracts and manipulates GENCODE annotations and provides easily-accessible data regarding annotations statistics, releases comparison, in addition to introns and splice sites data. Moreover, GencoDymo can produce fasta files of donor and acceptor splice sites motifs that can be directly uploaded to the MaxEntScan tool [3] for the calculation of splice sites scores.
